<h2>What are the stuff in parentheses/round brackets?</h2>

<p>
  In parentheses is the word category (or categories) of a particular word.
  The word categories used on this website are listed below; they work
  virtually the same way as in Cantonese (and to a lesser but still
  considerable extent, Mandarin), and so only the differences will be described
  here.
</p>

<p>
  These explanations of word categories are partially based on that of the
  fantastic ABC Chinese-English Dictionary.

<ul lang="en">
  <li>
    名 is short for 名詞, “noun”. This includes time words (e.g. 今日 geom3
    meot5, “today”) and proper nouns (騰訊 hang4 hleon3, “Tencent”), but
    excludes pronouns (你 ni3, “you (singular)”)
  </li>
  <li>代 is short for 代詞, “pronoun”.</li>
  <li>
    形 is short for 形容詞, “adjective” (though also called “stative verb”).
    Although its function is similar to adjectives in English, they behave a
    lot like verbs. For example, they have the sense of “to be” already
    embedded in them (e.g. 靚 liang3 means “to be beautiful” and not just
    “beautiful”). A more in-depth explanation about Chinese “adjectives” vs.
    verbs (in particular, stative verbs) can be found

  <li>代</li>
  <li>助</li>
  <li>
    動 is short for 動詞, “verb”. Note that this category doesn’t include
    verbs that are actually verb-object constructions, which are instead
    labeled 動賓 (see below).
  </li>
  <li>
    動賓 (literally “verb object”) is short for 動賓結構, “verb-object
    construction”, and is composed of a single-syllable verb with a
    single-syllable noun. A lot of Chinese verbs are actually verb-object
    constructions. These include 吃飯 (hiak3 fan6, “to eat a meal”) and
    偷稅 (heu3 sui3, “to evade taxes”). Chinese Grammar Wiki calls these
    separable verbs and explains how they work
