  Both my parents are from Duanfen (born late 1960s) in Duanfen. Since the
  pronunciations were elicited from them directly, they will virtually all be
  literary pronunciations (used in reading out written text, usually in
  compounds) instead of colloquial pronunciations (used in informal speech,
  usually in monosyllabic words).

  Middle Chinese data based on the 1981 edition of
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180529082256/http://fdjpkc.fudan.edu.cn/_upload/article/files/aa/1a/5156f64f4ce88a2ee0499adfd1d7/9d820868-2b1c-4ec1-8013-dc9062afb641.pdf<Paste>">方言調查字表（修訂本）</a>.
  Some notes on how the Middle Chinese data has been transferred to this
  database:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The use of smaller text beside the character, used in the source as
    examples of a character’s use (e.g. to clarify a character’s meaning)
    is represented here as the Note column.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a character has more than one form (shown in parentheses in the source),
    only the character outside brackets is used, due to Unicode issues and lack
    of significance in the context of this website.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a character has a more common, similar modern variant (e.g. 朵 instead
    of 朶, 群 instead of 羣), the character is changed to the modern variant
    without comment. That said, if the modern variant is drastically different
    (e.g. 葫蘆 instead of 瓠盧), the modern variant is included in the notes
    within {curly brackets} instead. A question mark (?) is used for
    uncertainty.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the rising changed tone is not taken into account.</p>
